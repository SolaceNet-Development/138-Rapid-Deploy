# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Best Practices

### Smart Contract Development
1. Use latest Solidity version
2. Follow security patterns
3. Implement access controls
4. Add emergency stops
5. Validate all inputs
6. Use safe math operations
7. Implement rate limiting
8. Add event logging

### Code Example
```solidity
contract SecureContract {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    
    // Access control
    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(isAdmin(msg.sender), "Not admin");
        _;
    }
    
    // Emergency stop
    modifier whenNotPaused() {
        require(!paused, "Paused");
        _;
    }
    
    // Rate limiting
    modifier rateLimited() {
        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastAction[msg.sender].add(RATE_LIMIT),
            "Rate limited"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    // Input validation
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(
            amount <= maxDeposit,
            "Exceeds limit"
        );
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Deployment Security
1. Use multi-signature wallets
2. Implement timelock delays
3. Verify contract code
4. Monitor transactions
5. Set up alerts

### Monitoring Example
```yaml
# security-alerts.yml
alerts:
  - name: large_transfer
    condition: transfer_amount > threshold
    actions:
      - notify_admin
      - pause_contract
      
  - name: unusual_activity
    condition: tx_frequency > normal_range
    actions:
      - investigate
      - rate_limit
```
